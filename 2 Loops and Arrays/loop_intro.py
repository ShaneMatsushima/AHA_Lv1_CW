# This is for introducing simple for loops in python
#
# Complete the TODO aspects of the code while progressing through each section of lectures
def loop_sum():
    # ======== DO NOT TOUCH =================
    sum = 0
    # =======================================

    # ========== START CODING HERE ==========
    # TODO Create a for loop that adds 1 after each loop to the variable sum 5 times
    # NOTE use the range function to iterate through a loop 


    # =======================================
    return sum

def while_loop():
    # ======== DO NOT TOUCH =================
    count = 0
    sum = 0
    # =======================================

    # ========== START CODING HERE ==========
    # TODO Create a while loop that keeps iterating count until count is 4
    # TODO inside the loop, add count to sum

    

    # =======================================
    return sum

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"sum in the for loop is {loop_sum()}")
    print(f"sum in the while loop is {while_loop()}")
