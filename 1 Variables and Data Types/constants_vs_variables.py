# Constants Vs Variables

# This is for students to understand and use Constants and variables
#
# Complete the TODO aspects of the code while progressing through each section of lectures

# ========== START CODING HERE ==========
# TODO Create a constant for PI (3.14159)

# TODO Create a constant for GRAVITY (9.81)

# TODO Create a variable for radius of a circle (24.38)

# TODO Calculate the area of the circle using the radius variable and PI constant
# You can square variables by using **2 (using * is for multiplication)
area_1 = 

# TODO Change the radius variable and recalculate the area of the circle

area_2 = 

# TODO Create a mass variable and use the GRAVITY constant to find the force
# mass should be 5.0
# force = mass * GRAVITY (gravitational acceleration on earth)

force = 

# =======================================

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Area of circle 1 is {area_1}")
    print(f"Area of circle 2 is {area_2}")
    print(f"Force is {force}")
